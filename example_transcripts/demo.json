   "content": " Well, he's the one who got rid of DACA protection in the first place, and to offer a temporary- temporary respite, it doesn't- If you talk to any DACA recipient in America today, they- they're anxious. They're worried. They're concerned, they might be at school. They don't know if they can finish school. They might be getting married. Their lives are being upended and this president has no compassion. So I don't think you should even consider this because it's three years is just DACA. Why not all the Dreamers? Why not a permanent pathway to citizenship so they actually can have certainty about their lives. What it really shows this is lack of compassion and empathy for people that are suffering. And I think it's a nonstarter. "

   "content": " No I don't. I don't take him on his word on anything. If he really cares about this, he would open up the government, stop the eight hundred thousand people that didn't get a paycheck last week, stop their suffering. Some people can't pay for medicines, food, heat, mortgages, rents. It's-It just shows a callousness that is unacceptable. And so open the government, pay the people pay our public servants, and then get to the business of talking about a comprehensive immigration reform. But to- to-start just- to offer him a three year DACA deal is just not- It doesn't accomplish what we need to accomplish. It's not enough. And I think it's cynical. "

   "content": "Well Democrats would have to agree to anything the president really puts forward in order to-to end the shutdown. But when I look at some of your past comments, you've said the president is ripping apart the moral fabric of our country. You have a consistent voting record of-of voting against us, many of his nominees. Do you think there's the possibility for any kind of proposal you could sign onto in the middle of this election campaign? "

   "speaker": "SEN GILLIBRAND",
   "content": "Well what I wish he would do is just open up the government under the agreement that we will make a deal with him and have time to actually meet it out. We do want as a starting measure to protect all dreamers. And so I can imagine that Democrats can talk to him about making sure that we protect all Dreamers. Democrats aren't afraid to protect this country. We will invest in border security. We will invest in anti-terrorism-- "

   "content": "I don't think that's the most effective way to do it. I think there is common ground here. If you focus on his goal- if he wants to keep terrorists out of this country if he wants to make sure there's no human trafficking and no drug trafficking and no gun trafficking, those are areas that we can work on. We will give him money for border security. If he just wants to throw it down the drain an ineffective barrier, it's just unwise. And so come to the table talk to us about the shared values of keeping America safe but care about the Dreamers, care about the kids who've been here a long time and who are adding to our communities. Immigration is our strength. Our diversity is a strength. We have always been a nation of immigrants. And for this president to sow so much fear about refugees, people who are seeking asylum, is just contrary to back to what you said the moral fabric of this country. We've always cared about others and that's what the Statue of Liberty stands for. "
